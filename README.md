# ChickenPox_SEIR_model_graph
This code illustrates a graph for the spread of chicken pox for the SEIR model.

SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model is frequently used for chickenpox (varicella) because the disease has a long incubation period (typically 10–21 days). During this time, individuals are "exposed" (infected but not yet contagious). 

The model divides a population into four primary compartments: 

    Susceptible (S): Healthy individuals who can contract the virus.
    Exposed (E): Infected individuals who are in the latent/incubation phase and cannot yet transmit the disease.
    Infectious (I): Individuals actively capable of spreading the virus to others.
    Recovered (R): Those who have overcome the infection and gained lifelong or temporary immunity.

**To run the code make sure that you have python interpreter and scipy, matplotlib installed on your computer.
Note that you can also run the code on an online python interpreter/compiler.**
